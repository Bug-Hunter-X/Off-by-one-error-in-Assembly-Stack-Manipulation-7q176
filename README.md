# Off-by-one error in Assembly Stack Manipulation
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in assembly language code that can lead to unexpected program behavior. The bug involves incorrect manipulation of stack variables, and the provided solution corrects the error for a more robust and predictable outcome.

## Bug Description:
The assembly code contains an off-by-one error when incrementing a value stored on the stack. The error occurs due to a subtle misunderstanding in stack pointer arithmetic, potentially leading to data corruption or unexpected program termination.

## Solution:
The solution provided addresses the off-by-one error by carefully adjusting the stack manipulation instructions. This ensures proper handling of stack pointer adjustments, avoiding any data corruption and guaranteeing a predictable program execution.
